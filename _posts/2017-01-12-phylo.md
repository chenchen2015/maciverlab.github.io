The R code in folder [fig02_phylo_orbit](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig02_phylo_orbit) can be used to create Figure 2 in the main paper.

The following packages have to be installed:


``` R
new.packages <- c("ape",
"geiger",
"phytools",
"strap",
"paleotree",
"nlme")
install.packages(new.packages)
```

To run the script in terminal or command prompt go to the directory of the script and type:


```
$ Rscript fig02.R --cwd
```

It will produce the following figure:
