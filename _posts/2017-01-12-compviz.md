The numerical model for both aquatic and aerial vision contains two components: calculation of the optical stimulus, which can overestimate visual range (particularly in the aerial case), and calculation of the effect of contrast threshold. The framework for calculation of the optical stimulus is adapted from Nilsson et al., which calculates visual range based on the assumption that there are two separate channels that view the background and the target, where channel size is determined by the angular size of the target on the retina (given a particular photoreceptor arrangement) for optimal viewing. Contrast follows the same attenuation law as light, and therefore the objects perceived contrast in absolute values less than its inherent contrast. The governing law in vision then becomes: if an object’s apparent contrast at a given range is smaller than the observer’s contrast threshold, the object is said to invisible.


The set of functions provided in folder [fig04_visualrange](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig04_visualrange) calculate:

1. Visual range for a 10cm disk in aquatic and aerial environments, for photopic, scotopic and mesopic viewing conditions
2. Visual sensory volume which is estimated by a spherical sector with radius equal to visual range, azimuth equal to 305º for aquatic and 287º for aerial, and elevation equal to 60º for aquatic and 30º for aerial vision.
3. Derivatives of both visual range and visual sensory volume with respect to pupil size a proxy  for performance/gain.


Parent folder (fig04_visualrange) has three subdirectories: [aquatic_model](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig04_visualrange/aquatic_model), [aerial_model](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig04_visualrange/aerial_model), and [figure_sensitivity](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig04_visualrange/figure_sensitivity). 


Figure folder has two functions that execute: 

1. Calculation of percent difference between visual range obtained from varying parameters and original parameter values
2. Generation of figure pdf that takes in the optional boolean argument *CONTRASTTHRESH*. If true, visual range that is calculated based on contrast threshold is plotted, and if false, visual range that is based on firing threshold is represented. The default value of *CONTRASTTHRESH* is set as true. 


``` Matlab
run fig04_visualrangeWsensitivity
```

This function generates the following figure (Figure 4):

The subdirectories *aquatic_model* and *aerial_model* contain the functions that calculate visual range based on firing and contrast threshold. Parameter values shown in Supplementary Appendix Table S1 can be modified in [Parameters.m](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/blob/master/figs/data/vision/Parameters.m) found under *figs/data/vision/*.


### Example run:

If we take the aquatic vision calculations as an example the primary folder that has the relevant code is [aquatic_model](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig04_visualrange/aquatic_model). Under this folder the functions *Aquatic_firingThresh.m* and *Aquatic_contrastThreshold.m* calculate visual range based on the firing threshold and contrast threshold method explained in detail in the Supplementary Appendix.  


*Aquatic_firingThresh.m* calculates visual range for upward and horizontal viewing directions for daylight, moonlight and starlight conditions based on the optical stimulus that reaches the eye. It generates the data file *meteoAquatic.mat* that has an array of discrete pupil values used and corresponding visual range (where 1st dimension is across pupil diameters, 2nd dimension is across environmental conditions and 3rd dimension is across viewing direction). 


*Aquatic_contrastThresh.m* checks to see if *meteoAquatic.mat* exists and if it does it iteratively calculates apparent contrast of the object at a given range, observers contrast threshold given viewing direction and condition, while decreasing visual range until the apparent contrast of the object is below the observers contrast threshold. This function generates the data file *visibilityAquatic.mat* that has the same arrays as *meteoAquatic.mat*.  


*Aquatic_calcVolumegetDer.m* takes in the optional *CONTRASTTHRESH*, which if true loads *visibilityAquatic.mat* and if false loads the data *meteoAquatic.mat*. The default value is true. This therefore provides an option to only use visual range calculations based on optical stimuli. The function calculates and returns visual volume from a spherical sector ,and derivatives of visual range and visual volume with respect to pupil diameters in mm. 

A correct sequence of runs then would be:


```Matlab
run Aquatic_firingThresh
run Aquatic_contrastThresh
run Aquatic_calcVolumegetDer
```

The folder titled [parameter_sensitivity](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig04_visualrange/aquatic_model/parameter_sensitivity) within *aquatic_model* folder calculates visual range for only daylight, based on alternative values given in Supplementary Appendix Table S2. The provided functions calculate visual range and performance metrics, for which visual range is saved separately based on the model used. 


*Aquatic_Sensitivity.m* calculates visual range based on optical stimulus and contrast threshold, and creates two data files *meteoAquaticSensitivityParameters.mat* (visual range based on firing threshold) and *visibilityAquaticSensitivityParameters.mat* (visual range based on contrast threshold) . These data files have an array of pupil values and corresponding visual ranges, where visual range in the 1st dimension is across pupil diameters, in the 2nd dimension across viewing direction, and in the 3rd dimension across perturbed parameters. It is important to note that the contrast threshold perturbation is not calculated within this function, and it only calculates parameter perturbations.


*Aquatic_contrastThreshSensitivity.m* calculates visual range based on the apparent contrast of the object and the observer’s contrast threshold perturbed.


*Aquatic_calcVolumegetDerSensitivity.m* behaves exactly the same as *Aquatic_calcVolumegetDer.m*. 

A sample run would look like:


```Matlab
run Aquatic_Sensitivity
run Aquatic_contrastThreshSensitivity
run Aquatic_calcVolumegetDerSensitivity
```

Similar runs with equivalent function definitions can be performed with the [aerial model](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/fig04_visualrange/aerial_model).


In the [figure_sensitivity](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/blob/master/figs/fig04_visualrange/figure_sensitivity/calculatePercentChange.m) folder, in addition to the main figure generating file there’s a helper function that calculates percent change due to parameter perturbations names *calculatePercentChange.m*. This file creates a data file *percChange.mat* which is imported into the figure file to create the green fill. This data file has structures that indicate the percent change, mean percent change, and visual ranges caused by each variable change. 


Once the figure generation file *fig04_visularange* is executed in Matlab it will search through all the directories to see if the data files are available, and if they are it will ask the user if they want to re-run all of the code and regenerate visual ranges. If they are not it will run the corresponding function to the missing data file. Once the data files are available they will be loaded and the figure will be drawn.
