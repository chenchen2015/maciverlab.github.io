title: Eye and eye socket size in teleost fishestags: [teleost fish, eye socket size]

To further explore the correlation of eye soft tissue structures to the bony eye socket, we turned to teleost reef fishes. We specifically were interested in the correlation between eye socket and eye diameter, as well as eye socket and pupil diameter. We performed regressions (standard as wells as phylogenetically informed) to test if there were considerable deviations from isometry, and then calculated the ratios of eye/orbit diameter and pupil/orbit diameter, respectively, which we illustrated by histograms. To reproduce these figures, open the terminal in folders [figExt04_abcd](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/figExt04abcd_orbit_eye) and [figExt04_efgh](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/figExt04efgh_orbit_pupil) and run the following scriptsâ€¦```$ Rscript figExt04_abcd.R --cwd$ Rscript figExt04_efgh.R --cwd
```

These will output and save the following figures:
