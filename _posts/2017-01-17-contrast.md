## Contrast extraction from images


Various images of centipedes and millipedes in their native habitats were found through Google images, as well as a collection of freshwater underwater fish images from stills and videos. These images can be found by following instructions under the *Data* tab (navigation side bar). The colored images were converted to gray scale for pixel luminance values since the luminance of an image is calculated by the log-average luminance which converts colored images to grayscale. In the grayscale image the object (centipede, millipede, and fish) was user-identified by drawing a border around the desired target. The average luminance of the object (mean of the pixel values within the identified region) was calculated and the location was then masked. Similarly mean background luminance (all of the image minus the masked area) was calculated. Object contrast was calculated by subtracting mean background luminance from object luminance over object luminance (Weber contrast). The images are loaded and the object contrasts are calculated by executing the following Matlab command:


```Matlab
run getBugContrast
```


This function creates the data file *imageContrastValues.mat* that has contrast values for centipede and millipede under *bugContrast* array, fish contrast values under *fishContrast*, and image file locations under *fileNames*. These values are not explicitly used in the visual range calculations. But were used as a reference to find a possible range of naturalistic contrast values. 



## Visual range dependence on contrast


By definition the intrinsic contrast of an object can range from black (no reflection) (-1) to isoluminous with background (0), and then self-illuminating (> 0 to ∞). Contrast is important in determining the apparent luminance of the object (amount of light that reaches the eye from the object). Therefore, as the absolute value of the contrast decreases, the visual range based on firing threshold also decreases. On the other hand, it is easy to see that the apparent contrast of the object determines whether the object is visible (above the observer’s contrast threshold). 


We ran our computational model by fixing the pupil diameter (D) to finned and digited tetrapod pupil diameters, and varied contrast from -1 (black) to 4 (snow), for daylight in both aquatic and aerial conditions. 

The main folder [figExt07_contrast](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/figExt07_contrast) has 4 folders which have the relevant codes for aerial model, aquatic model, contrast extraction from images and figure generation. 

In order to generate the figure simply type:

```Matlab
run figExt07_contrast
```

This code will output the following figure pdf:

Similar to computational visual ecology code, each helper function can be executed to save calculated visual range data for one model. 

### Example run

If we take the aquatic model as an example run, the main folder that contains the relevant code is [aquatic_model](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/figExt07_contrast/aquatic_model). Within this folder there is one function *Aquatic_daylightContrastRange.m* that calculates visual range for a set of contrast values and pupil diameters. Visual ranges are calculated, for both horizontal and upward viewing in daylight. The first part of the code calculates visual range based on firing threshold, and the second part decreases the range until the object becomes visible dependent on observer’s contrast threshold. Only one data file is created which has the range contrast values and pupil diameters, visual range values (where 1st dimension is across contrast, 2nd dimension is across pupil diameters, and 3rd dimension is across viewing). Unlike the computational visual code, the visual ranges calculated by using the simplified firing threshold model are not stored.


In order to execute the code type:


```Matlab
run Aquatic_daylightContrastRange.m
```

A similar execution can be done for the [aerial model](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/figExt07_contrast/aerial_model) to get aerial daylight visual ranges under varying contrast. 

These will generate the required data files for both aquatic and aerial model. Functions to plot the created data files can be found under the [figures](https://github.com/maciverlab/bigeye/tree/master/figs/figExt07_contrast/figures) folder. Within it there is a main functions which generates the figure, and a helper function which interpolates visual range values to include isoluminous object (contrast of 0) by using the fact that  when the contrast of an object is 0 visual range is 0. 

Once the figure generation file *figExt07_contrast* is executed in Matlab, it will search through all the directories to see if the data files (*daylightVisibilityAerialContrast.mat* and *daylightVisibilityAquaticContrast.mat*) exist. If they do, the program will ask the user if they want to re-run all of the code and regenerate visual ranges. If however they do not, the program will run the corresponding function to the missing data file. Once the data files are available they will be loaded and the figure will be plotted and saved as pdf.
